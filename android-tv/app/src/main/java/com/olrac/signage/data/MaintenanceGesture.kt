/**
 * The remote-control gesture that reveals the maintenance screen: Up, Up, Down, Down, OK
 * inside [WINDOW_MS].
 *
 * Deliberately not prefixed with Back. Back is exactly what someone presses when they want
 * out of a fullscreen app, so any sequence starting with it is the one most likely to fire
 * by accident on a public screen. Every key used here exists on every TV remote — media
 * keys do not, which is why the previous sequence needed two variants to cover the same
 * hardware.
 *
 * Secrecy is not the control: the pin on the screen behind this is. The gesture only has to
 * be something nobody produces by accident.
