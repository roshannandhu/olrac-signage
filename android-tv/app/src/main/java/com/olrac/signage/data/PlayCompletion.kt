/**
 * Why a play stopped, and what that means for the record written about it.
 *
 * Completion used to be inferred arithmetically: `durationMs < item.duration * 1000 - 2000`
 * meant "partial". That compared wall-clock time against the *playlist slot* duration,
 * which is not the length of the media. `PlaylistItem.duration` defaults to 10 seconds
 * whenever the content's real length has not been probed, so a five-second advert that
 * played from first frame to last was recorded as partial -- 5000 < 8000. Completion rate
 * is the number advertisers are billed on, so it was wrong in the one place it must not be.
 *
 * The player already knows exactly why it moved on. Recording that directly removes the
 * inference, and with it the whole class of bug: no threshold to tune, and it is equally
 * correct for a 5-second advert and a 5-minute one.
