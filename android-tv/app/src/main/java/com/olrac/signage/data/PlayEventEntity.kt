     * a device clock that may be hours wrong -- and because rollups bucket on
     * `corrected_started_at`, a week of offline plays landed in the wrong hours and stayed

     * Keeping the offset that was actually in force lets the upload distinguish the two
     * cases: an event stamped with a known offset is already right and is left alone, and
     * one stamped with no offset is corrected with the offset learned since. See
     * ProofOfPlayWorker.
