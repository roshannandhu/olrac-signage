"""Clients, tenant-sold plans, and paid extensions of a booking

Revision ID: e3f4a5b6c7d8
Revises: d2e3f4a5b6c7
Create Date: 2026-09-01

A booking recorded its buyer as a free-text `advertiser` string. That was enough to label a
row and nothing else: the same customer spelled two ways became two customers, there was
nowhere to keep the address a report has to be emailed to, and "everything we ran for this
client" could not be asked at all.

`tenant_plans` is deliberately NOT the existing `plans` table. That one is what OLRAC bills
the tenant; this is what the tenant sells on to an advertiser. One table for both would let
a tenant edit the plan they are billed on, and would show OLRAC's pricing to their clients.

`ad_placement_extensions` is a table rather than an `extended_to` column because a campaign
that does well is extended more than once, and each sale has to survive on the invoice. A
single column would overwrite the record of the first extension every time a second was
made.

`advertiser` is kept, not dropped. It is NOT NULL on every existing row, and the report
still has to name somebody for a booking whose client was later removed. The backfill below
gives every existing booking a real client row, after which the string is a denormalised
label written from the client on save.
