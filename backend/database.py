# redis.asyncio connections bind to the loop that created them. A single shared pool works
# perfectly under uvicorn, which runs one loop forever -- and then fails with
# "RuntimeError: Event loop is closed" the moment anything else touches Redis from a
# different loop: a TestClient request (a fresh loop per request), a management script, an
# asyncio.run() inside a threadpool worker.
#
# That failure mode is quiet in exactly the wrong way. Every Redis call in this codebase is
# wrapped in `except Exception` because Redis being down must not fail a TV's heartbeat, so
# a cross-loop error is swallowed and the feature just silently does nothing -- which is
# how a queued device command could be written and then never read back.

# Keyed weakly so a discarded loop takes its pool with it rather than accumulating one per
# request for the life of the process.
