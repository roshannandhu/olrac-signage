"""Sending mail, behind a single switch.

There was no mail path in this codebase at all -- only an aspirational note in worker.py
about "a failing SMTP server". Client reports have to reach a client, so this adds one.

stdlib `smtplib` rather than a provider SDK: it is one protocol, every provider speaks it
(Gmail, SES, Postmark, Resend all expose SMTP), and it adds nothing to requirements.txt.

Configuration is by environment, and absent configuration is reported rather than hidden.
A report that silently "sent" to nobody is worse than one that refuses -- the tenant tells
their client it is on the way and it never arrives.
