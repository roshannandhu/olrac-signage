"""Map imagery for reports, behind a single switch.

Everything map-related resolves through here so the provider is one decision rather than a
choice scattered across the report generator and the dashboard.

Google Static Maps is used when ``GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`` is set. Without a key there is no
map — the caller falls back to listing the locations in text. That is deliberate: the report
must still generate for someone who has not enabled billing yet, and OpenStreetMap's tile
policy forbids the kind of automated commercial image generation a client report at volume
would amount to.
