"""The commercial half of a booking: what was sold, what it cost, what was paid.

Split out of booking_report.py, which had grown into both documents at once -- proof of
delivery with the price, the paid/unpaid pill and the extension charges threaded through
its performance layout. That meant a tenant could not send a client evidence their advert
ran without also restating the terms, and there was no document that was actually an
invoice: the report was being forwarded in place of one.

Everything visual is imported from booking_report rather than restated. Two files drawing
the same letterhead would drift, and the one thing a client must never see is two documents
from the same tenant that do not look like the same company.
