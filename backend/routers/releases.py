# therefore not a tenant-level action -- a release created by one organisation's owner
# would install itself across the whole fleet, and on a device-owner TV it installs
# silently. Creation is restricted to `super_admin` for that reason.
#
# Reading stays open to any authenticated member: the dashboard's staged-rollout table
# needs the version list to label which build each of *its own* screens is pinned to.
