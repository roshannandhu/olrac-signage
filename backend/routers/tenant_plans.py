"""The packages a tenant sells to its own clients.

Deliberately separate from `models.Plan`, which is what OLRAC bills the TENANT. One table
for both would let a tenant edit the plan they are billed on, and would put OLRAC's pricing
in front of their customers.

A booking COPIES a plan's price and duration at the moment it is created (see
routers/placements.create_placement). Nothing downstream reads through to this table for
money, so repricing a plan never rebills a campaign that was already sold.
