"""How many bytes a workspace occupies, and what is actually in the bucket.

Two separate questions that were both being answered badly.

**Per workspace.** Three places counted a tenant's storage and only one counted it right.
`routers/content.py` enforces the quota against Content AND MediaRendition rows, because a
transcode writes a full-size master and a smaller copy on top of the upload -- summing only
the source measured roughly a third of what a video really occupies. The admin console and
the tenant's own billing page each summed Content alone, so both showed about a third of the
truth: a tenant read "3 GB of 10 GB used" and was then refused an upload for being full.
That is the same disease as the screen limit before `effective_max_screens` -- the number
shown and the number enforced reading different columns -- so there is now one function and
all three call it.

**Across the platform.** Nothing reported what the bucket itself holds. A per-tenant quota is
a promise about what a workspace MAY use; the object store is what actually gets billed, and
the two drift apart through orphans, renditions of deleted content, and anything uploaded
before a prefix convention changed.
