"""Destroying a workspace that an admin removed, once its 30 days are up.

Removal is a mark, not a delete (`Organization.deleted_at`), and this is the other half:
the job that makes it permanent. The gap between the two is the entire point -- an admin
who removes the wrong workspace has a month to put it back, and after that nothing of it
survives, neither rows nor bytes.

Three things make this harder than a cascade would suggest, and all three are why the
order below is written out by hand rather than left to `db.delete(org)`:

* Twelve of the eighteen tables carrying `organization_id` have a plain foreign key with
  no ON DELETE rule, so deleting the parent first simply fails.
* Five more tables belong to a workspace only transitively -- renditions through content,
  schedules through playlist items, targets and extensions through placements -- and carry
  no `organization_id` to filter on at all.
* SQLite does not enforce the ON DELETE CASCADE the rest rely on (`backend/database.py`
  sets no `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`), so anything leaning on the database to cascade would
  pass every test here and behave differently in production.

Objects go before rows, for the reason `prune_screenshots` already gives: the row is the
only pointer to the object, and dropping it first turns the object into an orphan nothing
can ever find again.
