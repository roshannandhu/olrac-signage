/**
 * Putting an advert on a screen when it may already be sold.
 *
 * The "+" beside a creative used to open Create New Booking unconditionally, which is right
 * for a first sale and wrong for every one after it. One advert sold once to one client is
 * ONE booking with several locations; making a second booking for the same sale charges the
 * client twice on the invoice, lists the campaign twice on their report, and — the quiet one
 * — spends a second ad slot out of the workspace's quota, so a tenant allowed ten slots hits
 * the cap at three real campaigns and cannot see why.
 *
 * So: look first, then ask. Never sold → straight through, no extra click. Already running →
 * offer to add these screens to the booking that exists. There is deliberately no "start a
 * separate one" escape hatch: the server refuses a second live booking of one creative for
 * the reasons above, so the only honest thing this dialog can do is say so.
