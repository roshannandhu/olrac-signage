/**
 * Live fleet alerts, pushed rather than polled.
 *
 * The server has published to `dashboard:{org}` and served an authenticated socket at
 * /api/ws/dashboard/ws since P6, but nothing in the dashboard ever opened it — there is no
 * other `new WebSocket` in this codebase. So the whole realtime path existed and delivered
 * nothing, and the alerts page fell back to re-fetching the entire screen list every thirty
 * seconds. This connects the half that was missing.
 *
 * Polling stays as the fallback exactly as the spec requires: if the socket never opens, or
 * drops and cannot reconnect, the queries underneath still refresh on their own interval.
 * This makes alerts *faster*, never load-bearing.
