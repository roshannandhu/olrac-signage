    Start every OLRAC Signage service and keep them running.

    Why this exists: the four services (Redis, media worker, API, dashboard) were being
    started as background jobs inside a terminal session. When that session ended, they
    all died together and the app looked broken — uploads stuck "processing", pages
    erroring, everything blamed on the code. Each service now runs in its own detached
    process that outlives whatever shell started it.

    In production use docker-compose instead; it has the same four services with
    restart: unless-stopped. This is the local equivalent for machines without Docker.

    Usage:   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\start-dev.ps1
    Stop:    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\stop-dev.ps1
