"""A booking's paid state is the shadow of a payment record, not a free-floating boolean.

`AdPlacement.is_paid` used to be the whole story: one flag, settable through the same
generic PUT that edits dates and price. It could say a campaign was paid while recording
no amount, no method, no date and no one accountable -- so a mis-click looked exactly like
a receipt, and "did they pay by UPI or was that the cheque that bounced?" had no answer.

What is pinned here:

* Recording a payment is the ONLY way a booking becomes paid. The generic PUT can no
  longer flip the flag, so the receipt and the flag cannot disagree.
* A ledger, not one settlement row. Recording a payment ADDS a receipt; what the client
  has handed over is their SUM. It used to overwrite, so a client's second instalment
  erased their first -- amount, date, method and reference -- and filed them as having
  paid a fraction of what they really had. A wrong receipt is deleted, not edited, and
  removing one leaves the others standing.
* Clearing wipes every receipt and puts the booking back to unpaid, including for
  bookings marked paid before payments existed and which have no row to delete.
* "Paid" means the balance is ZERO, not that some money arrived. A part payment leaves the
  booking part paid and reports what is still owed, and anything that moves the total --
  an extension, an upgrade, a corrected price -- re-settles it against what was received.
* A payment belongs to its tenant and its booking, and dies with the booking.
