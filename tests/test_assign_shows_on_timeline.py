"""Booking an advert onto a screen must put it on that screen's playback timeline.

The screen page renders PlaylistBuilder against `effective_playlist_id` and nothing else,
so "I assigned the ad and the timeline is empty" is exactly this chain breaking:

    create placement -> playlist_for_target -> screen.playlist_id -> effective_playlist_id
                                            -> PlaylistItem in that playlist

Three shapes a screen can be in when the booking lands, because they take different
branches in playlist_for_target and only the first is obvious:

  1. no playlist at all     -> one is provisioned
  2. its own playlist       -> the advert is appended to it
  3. inherits a group loop  -> it is FORKED to the screen, seeded with what it was already
                               playing, and the advert lands on top
