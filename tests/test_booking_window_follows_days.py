"""A booking sold by per-location days is as long as its longest location.

The reported case: sell one screen 10 days and another 30, without naming a plan or an end
date. The campaign IS 30 days -- that is when the last location stops -- so the booking has
to be sold as 30, not as whatever date happened to be in the form.

The running side was always right: place_advert gives each target its own window and
AdPlacement.effective_ends_at takes the max of the booking, its extensions and every
per-location window. What was wrong was the SOLD window, which the operator, the invoice
and the bookings list all read.

Deliberately not changed: a sold window is never rewritten AFTER the fact. Selling a
location a longer run later leaves the original deal alone -- test_per_location_ad_window
covers that, and it stays true. This is only about getting it right at the moment of sale.

Throwaway Postgres database. Run directly:
