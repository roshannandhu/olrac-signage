"""Media storage: fetch and store, on local disk and on object storage.

The transcoder refused outright on any `s3://` source, so with R2 configured -- the
deployment the README documents -- every video upload ended `status="failed"` and no
rendition was ever produced. These checks pin the fetch/store pair that replaced the
refusal, on both backends, without needing ffmpeg or a database.

Run directly:  python tests/test_media_storage.py

    this module and `test_media_worker.py` into the SAME process, and this file sorts
    first, so the worker there resolved every media path under a directory that no longer
    existed, failed with FileNotFoundError, and recorded the upload as `failed`. Both files
    passed alone; the suite was red. The `s3` fixture below leaked the same way, restoring
    only AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and leaving the bucket name behind.
