"""No storage credential is ever written into tracked source.

This exists because "thumbnail not showing" kept coming back, and every time the cause was
the same: somebody made media work by hardcoding an object-storage key somewhere and
signing URLs next to it. It has happened in a public backend module and in the browser
bundle, where the credentials were served to every visitor.

The fix each time was to delete the signer and let the backend's `/api/media/<key>` do it,
which signs fresh on every request and cannot expire or drift. That fix does not stick on
its own -- hardcoding a key makes images appear immediately, so it keeps getting re-added
under pressure, and it keeps breaking again the moment the key rotates or a signature ages
out. This test is what makes it stick.

Pure logic: reads files, touches nothing.
