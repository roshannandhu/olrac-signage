"""One account on the TV and the dashboard, and a screen that survives a reinstall.

    python tests/test_reinstall_reconnect.py

The scenario this covers is the one an installer actually performs:

  1. The installer signs in ON THE TV with the same OLRAC account they use in the
     dashboard. The screen joins that workspace with nobody else involved.
  2. The dashboard shows exactly ONE screen -- not a ghost row per attempt.
  3. Content is assigned; the TV plays it.
  4. The app is reinstalled (or its data cleared). The TV must come back as the SAME
     screen, keep its playlist, and resume playing without anyone signing in again.
  5. A factory reset rotates ANDROID_ID, so the device id changes too. The screen is
     reclaimed through the installation id instead, and still does not duplicate.

Every step asserts the fleet count, because duplication is the failure mode that is
invisible until a quota is hit or a client is billed for screens that do not exist.
