"""Clients and tenant-sold plans belong to one tenant, and a plan's terms are copied not linked.

Two properties are under test, and both silently corrupt a business rather than raising:

* Isolation. A tenant's client list is their customer list -- names, addresses and phone
  numbers -- and their plans are their pricing. Neither may be readable, bookable against,
  or editable by another tenant.
* Copy-on-sale. A booking takes its price and duration from a plan at the moment it is
  made. If it read through instead, repricing a package next quarter would restate every
  invoice already issued under the old one.

Throwaway Postgres database. Run directly:  python tests/test_tenant_plans.py
